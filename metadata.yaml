description: Jack found a fairy's nest in a tree in the meadow. After sharing a bit
  of cake with the baby fairies in it, he is whisked off by an albatross to Fairyland,
  where he rescues the Fairy Queen. One of the fairies from the nest, Mopsa, wakes
  up, and together they travel all over Fairyland.
